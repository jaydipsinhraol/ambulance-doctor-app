## Context

Accident cases are increasing more nowadays. So this app needs to display the list of all nearby ambulance services and doctors based on location with one click.


## Product Requirements

- [ ] I want to add, edit, update and delete the ambulances and doctors .
- [ ] I want to see a list of ambulances and doctors.

- [ ] I want to see a total ambulances and doctors in the app.
- [ ] For each record I want to see:
  - [ ] Title
  - [ ] Description
  - [ ] Location
  - [ ] Image of the ambulance or doctor, if available
- [ ] I want to see a loading state until the list is available.
- [ ] I want to see an error state if the list is unavailable.
- [ ] I want to see an empty state if there are no results.

## Your Mission

Create a React application that satisfies all must-have requirements above, plus any nice-to-have requirements you wish to include. Please keep your creative juices flowing for designs.

For that, youâ€™ll need to make requests to your nodeJS API to get JSON content and print it on view.

You can use a in-memory JSON file for your CRUD operations or use SQLite to make the CRUD operations simple to match the use case.

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer (nextjs, create react app, ...), but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favorite tools and packages to build a solid React application.

You can assume that you do not have to support legacy browsers. Feel free to use modern features such as fetch or flexbox.

Once you are done with the above requirements, please share your source code via github for review with a proper README. Perhaps also mention if there is some seed data involved to get started. We don't expect you to deploy your application but it in case you do you will receive extra brownie points.
